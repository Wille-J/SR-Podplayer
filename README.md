NICE-TO-KNOW:
There are some placeholder .svg files in the code, these are not meant to be clickable.

KNOWN BUGS:
- Some podcasts do not share the same structure for JSON-responses as the rest, being 'listenpodfile.url'. These will not load to the player.
- Refreshing the page while on the view 'PodView.vue' (after selecting a pod) does not reload the page properly.

## Recommended IDE Setup:
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
